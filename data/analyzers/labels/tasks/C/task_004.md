You are a dramaturg reading the scene as an audience member would experience it. Follow who is doing what to whom moment by moment, then label.

## What to label

Each scene is given as numbered units. `A` = one sentence of action/description text (¶ marks the
first sentence of a paragraph). `D` = one dialogue block, shown as `NAME [extensions] (parenthetical): text`.

Produce one JSON object per scene:

{
  "scene_id": "<id>",
  "cast": {"<every character name variant used in the scene>": "<canonical name>", ...},
  "beats": [<unit numbers that START a beat, ascending; the first non-heading unit always starts one>],
  "lines": {
    "<n>": {"t": "A"|"D"|"S", "who": ["<canonical>", ...], "emo": {"<canonical>": ["<emotion>", <0-1>]}, "c": <0-1>},   // for A units
    "<n>": {"to": ["<canonical>"|"ALL"|"SELF"|"NONE", ...], "emo": ["<emotion>", <0-1>], "c": <0-1>}                     // for D units
  }
}

Rules:
- cast: map EVERY name variant (cue names, CAPS introductions, aliases like STRANGER -> INGRID once named,
  DET. RUIZ / RUIZ) to one canonical name per real person. Unnamed extras get a short canonical (e.g. "GUARD").
- Every A and D unit must appear in "lines" (skip the heading and transitions).
- A units, field t: "A" = a character does something (acts, moves, speaks-without-cue, reacts);
  "D" = a character is described (appearance, introduction, state) ; "S" = no character: setting, objects, sound,
  atmosphere. who = the character(s) performing the action or being described, as canonical names; empty for "S".
  Use several names only when they genuinely act jointly ("They fight", "Both freeze"). Resolve every pronoun.
  If the actor is a crowd or someone not in the cast, use "OTHER".
- D units: to = who the line is addressed to. "ALL" = the group, "SELF" = muttered/thinking aloud,
  "NONE" = no listener (e.g. pure voice-over narration). A phone/radio listener counts as a character.
- emo: emotion actually conveyed by the line's text, subtext, parenthetical or behaviour - not guessed from the
  plot. One of: neutral, joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, affection, with intensity 0-1
  (neutral -> 0-0.2). For A units give emo only for characters whose emotion the sentence shows; otherwise {}.
- c = your confidence that who/to is right (0-1). Be honest: ambiguous pronouns deserve low confidence.
- beats: a beat is the smallest unit in which something dramatically changes - an action, a reaction, a shift
  in tactic, a reveal, an entrance. A beat may be dialogue only, action only, or mixed, and may split an action
  paragraph. Typical beats are 1-8 units long.

Detected names (may be incomplete or contain aliases): NORA, THE WOMAN, VIVIAN, THE TWINS, DEV, ILSA
1 A ¶ The salon smells of acetone and jasmine, and under that of something else, something nobody in the room has named yet; the dryers hum in a steady chord, the television above the pedicure chairs plays a cooking show on mute, and at the third station a woman in a grey hoodie sits with both hands flat on the table as though she were waiting for them to be read.
2 D NORA (filing, not looking up): Any plans for the weekend, hon?
3 D THE WOMAN (voice flat, eyes on the window): Not really. Maybe visit my sister. She lives out past the reservoir.
4 D NORA (brightly): Oh that's nice. Family is everything.
5 D THE WOMAN (beat): Is it.
6 A ¶ Nora glances up.
7 A Behind the counter, VIVIAN rings up a customer, tucking a stray lock behind her ear, and at the far chair THE TWINS, identical in matching pink smocks, murmur to each other in a rhythm too even to be conversation.
8 D THE TWINS (together, softly): Do you smell it? Do you smell it?
9 D VIVIAN (not turning, counting change): Girls, enough with the perfume jokes.
10 D THE TWINS (together): Not perfume.
11 D NORA (forcing a laugh): They get like this when it rains. Ignore them.
12 D THE WOMAN (finally looking at Nora): It's not raining.
13 A ¶ A silence.
14 A The cooking show on the television flickers, goes to static, comes back.

17 D VIVIAN (sharply, not turning): Dev. Floor.
18 D DEV (obeying, quieter): Sorry. Sorry.
19 D NORA (trying again, painting a clear coat): So, what do you do, hon? For work?
20 D THE WOMAN (a thin smile): I count things. How many people, how many exits. How long the lights stay on.
21 D NORA (her brush stilling): That's a strange job.
22 D THE WOMAN (beat): It's a strange week.
23 A ¶ The Twins stop murmuring.
24 A Both rise from their chairs at the same instant, smocks rustling, and the room tilts toward them.
25 D THE TWINS (together, calm): She is early.
26 D VIVIAN (finally turning, color draining): Who is early?
27 D THE TWINS (together, pointing at the hoodie): Her. She was not supposed to come until Thursday.
28 D NORA (whispering, to the woman): Hon, what are they talking about?
29 D THE WOMAN (pushing back her hood to reveal pale, almost translucent skin): My name is Ilsa. And I am so sorry. I wanted one last manicure before the end.
30 D DEV (dropping the broom): The end of what?
31 D ILSA (rising, her hands beginning to glow faintly under the dryer lamps): Of this. All of it. They said you'd want to know.
32 D VIVIAN (very quiet): Nobody here asked.
33 D ILSA (gently): Nobody ever does.
34 A ¶ The television goes black.
35 A Every dryer in the salon stops at once, and in the sudden quiet a single drop of polish falls from Nora's brush and rings against the tabletop like a bell.

9 A Ash, 30s, they/them, enters in a velvet blazer, holding a tray of leftover champagne flutes like a waiter at a very strange restaurant.

39 A The streamers stop swaying.
40 A The candles on the tables light themselves, one by one, in a perfect ring around the dance floor.

42 D ASH (not joking): The DJ left at ten.
43 D DJ [V.O.] (over speaker, shaking): Guys... I'm still in the booth. I didn't press anything.
44 A ¶ The door at the end of the hall SWINGS open on its own.
45 A A figure in a long pale dress stands there, face hidden, hands folded in front like a bride.
46 D GWEN (small): Is that... is that Priya's grandmother?
47 D ASH: Priya's grandmother died in March.

54 D GWEN: Oh, I love that plan.
55 A ¶ They bolt for the exit together.
56 A The side door SLAMS shut behind them.
57 A The song swells.
58 A ¶ The figure lifts its veil.
59 A ¶ Underneath, grinning, is the DJ.
60 D DJ (lowering the headset): Gotcha.
61 D DJ [V.O., CONT'D] (over speaker, offended): Hey! That's my line.

9 D WALTER: Fares, please. Fares. Last bus tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Last bus and last chance.
10 D EDITH (tired, smiling): You say that every night, Mr Penn.

27 A Alistair folds the newspaper at last, slow and exact, and looks at her for the first time.
28 D ALISTAIR: That's very generous. I wonder you can afford it, on a nurse's wage.
29 D EDITH (level): I wonder you can afford that coat, on whatever it is you do.
30 D WALTER (a warning): Now then.
31 D ALISTAIR: I do very well, thank you. I take an interest in people who leave their patients at night.
32 D EDITH: I haven't left anyone.
33 D ALISTAIR (softly): Mrs Harcourt, in the end bed. She'd be a good deal more comfortable if you'd stayed.
34 A ¶ Edith goes still.
35 A The engine drones.
36 A Tommy has stopped kicking.
37 A ¶ BACK TO SCENE: the bus slows at a stop where no one waits, the doors hiss, and cold air comes in carrying the smell of coal smoke.
38 D EDITH (very quiet): Who are you?
39 D ALISTAIR: Someone who reads the ward reports.
40 D WALTER: I think, sir, you'd best get off here.
41 D ALISTAIR: I think I'll ride to the terminus, conductor. I've paid.
42 D TOMMY (tugging Edith's sleeve): Miss, is he a policeman?
43 D EDITH (a long beat): No, love. I think he's only lonely.
44 A ¶ Alistair's face flickers, the tiniest crack.
45 A He looks at the boy, then at the fogged window, then at his own reflection, which looks like someone he would rather not be.
46 D ALISTAIR (low): Mrs Harcourt died at nine. I was her son.
47 D EDITH (stricken): I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
48 D ALISTAIR: No. Nobody did. She said you were kind.
49 A ¶ Walter takes off his cap.
50 A The doors hiss shut.
51 A The bus pulls away into the fog, and no one says anything else.
