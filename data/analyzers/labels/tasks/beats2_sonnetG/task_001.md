You segment screenplay scenes into DRAMATIC BEATS for a screenwriting tool (timeline, mood track, outline).

A dramatic beat is one exchange of action and reaction around a single intention: a character pursues something with
one tactic, and the beat ends when the tactic, the power balance, the subject or the situation changes (a reveal, an
entrance or exit, a decision, a turn in the argument, a new attempt after a failure). Scenes usually have 3-8 beats;
a short scene can have 1-2, a long one up to ~12.
- A beat usually spans SEVERAL paragraphs and dialogue blocks. Do NOT start a beat at every paragraph or speaker change.
- Keep the setup (setting and introductions before anything is at stake) inside the first beat unless it is long
  and self-contained.
- A beat may start in the middle of an action paragraph if the turn happens there.

For each beat give:
- "start": unit number where it starts (the first content unit starts beat 1)

24 D HELENA: Backup is slow. The journal is here.
25 D DETECTIVE GRANT [V.O.]: Don't touch anything. We think Warrick didn't die alone.
26 D HELENA (shining the light across the floor): I'm not alone either.

10 D ABBOTT-LUND: Mr. Pratt, you dispute it?
11 D PRATT: We do, Your Honor. My client wasn't informed of the rent increase.
12 D DEXTER: It was posted in the lobby.
13 D MARISELA: There's no lobby. There's a hallway.
14 D DEXTER: Same thing.
15 D MARISELA: There's a hallway with a broken light. I can't read in the dark.
16 D ABBOTT-LUND: Ms. Quintanilla, please address me.
17 D MARISELA: Sorry, Judge.
18 D ABBOTT-LUND: Mr. Pratt, any further objection?

20 D DEXTER: I replaced the stove.
21 D MARISELA: With a hot plate.

19 A ¶ A deep groan rolls through the shell.
20 A Crates slide.
21 A A lantern shatters.
22 D PERRIN (to everyone, louder): Brace! Brace!
23 D KIT (to himself): Don't fall, don't fall, don't fall.

9 D LOLO: It's the final scores.

### SCENE pd_earnest_1 | INT. EARNEST - CONTINUOUS
Detected names (may be incomplete or contain aliases): JACK, GWENDOLEN, LADY BRACKNELL
1 D JACK: You really love me, Gwendolen?
2 D GWENDOLEN: Passionately!
3 D JACK: Darling! You don’t know how happy you’ve made me.
4 D GWENDOLEN: My own Ernest!
5 D JACK: But you don’t really mean to say that you couldn’t love me if my name wasn’t Ernest?
6 D GWENDOLEN: But your name is Ernest.
7 D JACK: Yes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to say you couldn’t love me then?
8 A ¶ Glibly.
9 D GWENDOLEN: Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.
10 D JACK: Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don’t much care about the name of Ernest . . . I don’t think the name suits me at all.
11 D GWENDOLEN: It suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own. It produces vibrations.
12 D JACK: Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.
13 D GWENDOLEN: Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment’s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.
14 D JACK: Gwendolen, I must get christened at once—I mean we must get married at once. There is no time to be lost.
15 D GWENDOLEN: Married, Mr. Worthing?
16 A ¶ Astounded.
17 D JACK: Well . . . surely. You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.
18 D GWENDOLEN: I adore you. But you haven’t proposed to me yet. Nothing has been said at all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.
19 D JACK: Well . . . may I propose to you now?
20 D GWENDOLEN: I think it would be an admirable opportunity. And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.
21 D JACK: Gwendolen!
22 D GWENDOLEN: Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?
23 D JACK: You know what I have got to say to you.
24 D GWENDOLEN: Yes, but you don’t say it.
25 D JACK: Gwendolen, will you marry me?
26 A ¶ Goes on his knees.
27 D GWENDOLEN: Of course I will, darling. How long you have been about it! I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.
28 D JACK: My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.
29 D GWENDOLEN: Yes, but men often propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does. All my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest! They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.
30 A ¶ Enter Lady Bracknell.
31 D LADY BRACKNELL: Mr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture. It is most indecorous.
32 D GWENDOLEN: Mamma!
33 A ¶ He tries to rise; she restrains him.
34 D GWENDOLEN: I must beg you to retire. This is no place for you. Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet.
35 D LADY BRACKNELL: Finished what, may I ask?
36 D GWENDOLEN: I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.
37 A ¶ They rise together.
38 D LADY BRACKNELL: Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing. While I am making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.

45 A Finally turns round.
46 D LADY BRACKNELL: Gwendolen, the carriage!
47 D GWENDOLEN: Yes, mamma.
48 A ¶ Goes out, looking back at Jack.

103 D ADAEZE: Monday, you said.
104 D LEV: The photocopier smears.
105 D JUDGE TRAN: It is a pen, Mr. Brandt. A felt-tip. Not a copier.
106 D LEV: I can explain.
107 D ADAEZE: Please. Do.
108 D LEV: It was a... a re-signing. For the file.
109 D JUDGE TRAN: By whom?

44 A Her knuckles are swollen, her skin like old paper.
45 A He turns his palm up and holds on.
46 D BABCIA: Every spring the swallows go away, and every spring they return. Nobody tells them to. They only remember where the barn is.

8 A WILFRED PRATT (70s, retired astronomer, a cane, a rumpled evening jacket).
9 A And MEI-LING TAN (20s, journalist, notebook, recorder held out like a candle).
10 D HETTY: Who last saw Doctor Marrow?
11 D BASTIAN: Soli did. She locked up at nine.
12 D SOLI: I locked the north door. I did not lock the dome.
13 D PRATT: Soledad, my dear, a dome has no door. It is a lid.
14 D SOLI: Then I locked the lid, Mr. Pratt.
15 D MEI-LING: Let's slow down. Soli, you said Doctor Marrow asked you for the keys?
16 D SOLI: He asked. I said no.
17 D BASTIAN: You told me you gave them to him.
18 D SOLI: I told you he asked, Bash. You heard what you wanted.
19 D HETTY: Bastian. Where were you at nine?
20 D BASTIAN: Plate room. Cataloguing.
21 D PRATT: For five hours? That's not cataloguing, it's meditation.
22 D BASTIAN: It was the Hartwell plates, Mr. Pratt. You know how many there are.
23 D PRATT: I know how many there were. I counted them in 1989.
24 D MEI-LING: Mr. Pratt, you told me earlier you hadn't been to the observatory in years.
25 D PRATT: Did I?
26 D MEI-LING: Your exact words were, "I haven't set foot on this hill since the Marrow appointment."
27 D PRATT: Then I was speaking figuratively.
28 D HETTY: Wilfred. You have a key.
29 D PRATT: Everyone has a key, Hetty. That's the tragedy of the institution.
30 D SOLI: I don't think everyone has a key.
31 D HETTY: Soli, who does?
32 D SOLI: Me. You. Doctor Marrow.
33 D BASTIAN: And Pratt, apparently.
34 D PRATT: Apparently.
35 D MEI-LING: So four keys. And a coat on the floor.
36 D HETTY: Don't touch the coat, Miss Tan.
37 D MEI-LING: I wasn't going to.
38 D SOLI: You were. You've been inching toward it for five minutes.
39 D MEI-LING: I'm a reporter. Inching is the job.
40 D PRATT: Inching is how the best of us died, my girl.
41 D HETTY: Wilfred, enough.
42 D PRATT: I'm only saying. The coat is on the floor, the lid is open, and Doctor Marrow is not in either of them. Somebody in this room is going to have to explain that. And I would very much like for it not to be me.
43 D BASTIAN: Then explain why your cane is wet.
44 A ¶ A silence.
45 A The telescope creaks.
46 D PRATT: It rained.
47 D SOLI: It hasn't rained since Tuesday.
48 D HETTY: Wilfred.
